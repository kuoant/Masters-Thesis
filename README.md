This repository contains the complete implementation and analysis for my Master's Thesis at the University of Basel, focusing on advanced machine learning approaches (GNN, transformers & XGBoost) for tabular data analysis, with an emphasis on loan default prediction.

## üéØ Project Overview

This research investigates the application of state-of-the-art machine learning models to tabular data, comparing state-of-the-art enriched with representations from modern deep learning architectures:

- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** for capturing graph relationships
- **Transformer architectures** adapted for text in tabular data
- **Diffusion Models** for synthetic data generation
- **XGBoost** as baseline comparison

### Key Research Questions
- How do modern deep learning approaches compare to traditional methods on tabular data?
- Can Graph Neural Networks effectively model feature relationships in loan default prediction?
- What is the impact of different preprocessing and embedding strategies?
